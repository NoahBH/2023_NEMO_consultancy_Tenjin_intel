| **REQUEST**      | 1.  The clients want to know the quality of the data and the potential impact of systematic distortions, signal drop-out, and measurement noise.                                                                    |
|                  | 2.  They would like an analysis pipeline to investigate these potential quality issues and to provide a smoothed and interpolated location time series, which would be used to fit a model of \~2Hz step decisions. |
